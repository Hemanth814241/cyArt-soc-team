\# Week 4 Capstone – SOC Incident Response



\## Overview

This capstone demonstrates an end-to-end SOC workflow covering threat hunting, SOAR design, post-incident analysis, adversary emulation, and executive reporting.



\## Key Activities

\- Threat hunting using Wazuh authentication logs (4624/4625).

\- SOAR playbook design for phishing response using TheHive (design-only).

\- Post-incident analysis with RCA and SOC metrics (MTTD/MTTR).

\- Adversary emulation planning mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK T1566.

\- Security metrics and executive reporting for leadership visibility.



\## Outcome

The workflow validates detection capability, reduces response time through automation, and improves SOC maturity through continuous improvement.
