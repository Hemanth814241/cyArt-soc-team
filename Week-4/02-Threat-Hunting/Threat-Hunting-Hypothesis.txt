Threat Hunting Hypothesis – Week 4

Hypothesis:
An attacker may have gained unauthorized access by abusing valid domain accounts
and escalated privileges without triggering high-severity alerts.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Technique ID: T1078 – Valid Accounts

Rationale:
Attackers frequently abuse legitimate credentials to maintain persistence and
perform privilege escalation while evading traditional alert-based detection.

Objective:
Identify anomalous privilege escalation events that may indicate misuse of
valid accounts in the environment.
