Threat Hunting Query Plan – Week 4

Target Technique:
T1078 – Valid Accounts

Query Objective:
Identify abnormal privilege escalation and suspicious login behavior
related to misuse of valid user accounts.

Planned Queries:

1. Check Windows Security Logs
   - Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned)
   - Purpose: Find users getting admin rights unexpectedly.

2. Analyze Successful Logons
   - Event ID 4624
   - Focus on:
     - Logons outside business hours
     - Remote logon types
   - Purpose: Detect suspicious login activity.

3. Correlation Logic
   - Event ID 4624 followed by Event ID 4672 within 5 minutes
   - Purpose: Detect quick privilege escalation after login.

Expected Outcome:
This plan helps detect attackers abusing valid credentials
to escalate privileges without triggering obvious alerts.
