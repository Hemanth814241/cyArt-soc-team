Findings Table:

| Timestamp           | Username   | Event ID | Observation                          |

| 2025-08-18 15:00:00 | testuser01 | 4672     | Unexpected admin privilege assignment |

Analysis:
The identified event shows a user account receiving elevated privileges
without a corresponding change request or administrative approval. This
behavior may indicate misuse of valid credentials for privilege escalation.

Conclusion:
The threat hunting activity supports the hypothesis that attackers can
abuse valid accounts to gain elevated privileges while evading traditional
alert-based detection mechanisms.
