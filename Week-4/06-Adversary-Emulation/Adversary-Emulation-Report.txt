Adversary Emulation Report – Week 4

Emulation Technique:
MITRE ATT&CK T1566 – Phishing

Emulation Tool:
MITRE Caldera (simulated activity)

Attack Scenario:
A spear-phishing email containing a malicious attachment was simulated
to evaluate SOC detection and response capabilities.

Detection Mechanism:
Wazuh SIEM was configured to monitor suspicious email activity
and file execution events on the endpoint.

Detection Result:

| Timestamp           | TTP   | Detection Status | Notes                     |
|---------------------|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 2025-08-18 17:00:00 | T1566 | Detected         | Phishing attempt blocked  |

Analysis:
The simulated phishing activity was successfully detected by the SOC
monitoring controls, demonstrating effective alerting and visibility.

Conclusion:
Adversary emulation helped validate existing detection rules and
highlighted the importance of continuous testing against real-world
attack techniques.
