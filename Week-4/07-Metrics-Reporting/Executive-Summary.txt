Executive Security Summary – Week 4

During this period, the Security Operations Center (SOC) identified and
responded to a phishing-related security incident. The threat was detected
within a short time frame and successfully contained without business
disruption.

Key performance indicators show that the SOC detected the incident within
two hours and fully responded within four hours. This demonstrates effective
monitoring, alert triage, and response processes.

To further improve security posture, continued investment in automation,
threat hunting, and employee awareness training is recommended. These
measures will help reduce detection time and strengthen defenses against
future attacks.
