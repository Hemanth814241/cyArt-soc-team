Capstone SOC Incident Response Report – Week 4

Executive Summary:
A simulated phishing-based security incident was detected and handled
by the Security Operations Center (SOC). The incident involved suspicious
file download activity originating from an external source. Prompt
detection and automated response mechanisms prevented further impact.

Incident Timeline:
- Initial Activity Detected: Phishing alert generated by Wazuh SIEM
- Alert Triage: High-priority alert reviewed and validated
- Response Action: Malicious IP blocked and incident case created
- Containment: Endpoint communication restricted
- Closure: Incident documented and reviewed

Detection and Triage:
The SOC detected the incident through proactive monitoring and alert
triage processes. The alert was classified as high priority due to the
potential risk of malware execution.

Response and Containment:
Automated SOAR playbooks were used to validate indicators, block
malicious IP addresses, and create an incident case for investigation.

Post-Incident Analysis:
Root cause analysis indicated phishing as the initial attack vector.
Metrics such as MTTD and MTTR were calculated to assess SOC performance.

Metrics Summary:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): 2 hours
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): 4 hours
- Dwell Time: 6 hours

Recommendations:
- Enhance phishing awareness training
- Expand threat hunting coverage
- Increase automation for faster containment

Conclusion:
The capstone exercise demonstrated an effective SOC workflow covering
detection, response, analysis, and reporting. Continuous improvement
through automation and metrics-driven insights will further strengthen
security operations.
